#

### Built with. üî®

- React.
- Vanilla CSS.
- Framer Motion.
- Vite.

#

### Notes. üìå

- The font sizes in the design file were going as low as 11px and 13px, which I think is too small. Instead I used 14px and 16px, making the text easier for users to read. Because of that, my solution is bit larger than the original design, but I think it's better than forcing the user to read very small text.
- I also used a background blend mode on the background image of the first testimonial, so that it‚Äôs more subtle and doesn‚Äôt interfere with the text that is in front of it.

#

### Features. ‚ú®

- Added some view based animations using Framer Motion.
- Used the `useReducedMotion` hook to make sure that users who have reduced motion setting enabled don't see the animations, providing a smoother experience for them.

#

### New Things Learned. üéì

- Using the Framer Motion Library.

#

### Testing and Accessibility. üß™

- Used the Responsively App to check the site's appearance on various screen sizes, from 320x480 to 3000x2000.
- Set the browser font size on desktop to various values ranging from 9px to 72px to ensure everything on the site scales properly with the user's preferred browser font size.
- Zoomed the page in and out using Ctrl + Scroll wheel (up to 500%).
- Tested with the NVDA screen reader.
- Viewed the site on an iPhone 11 in both portrait and landscape modes.
